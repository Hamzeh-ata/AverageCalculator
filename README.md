# Average Calculator

This console application reads a list of integers from the user, calculates the average, and then displays the result. It provides a simple interface for entering numbers and uses a sentinel value for input termination.

## Requirements

- **User Input**: The application prompts the user to enter a series of integers, one at a time.
- **Termination**: Input is terminated when the user enters a specific character or number, specifically "-1".
- **Calculation**: After terminating input, the application calculates the average of the entered integers.
- **Output**: Displays the calculated average to the user.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Application**: Run the application in your preferred C# environment.
2. **Enter Numbers**: When prompted, enter one integer at a time. After each entry, press `Enter` to submit the number.
3. **Terminate Input**: To finish entering numbers and calculate the average, type `-1` and then press `Enter`.
